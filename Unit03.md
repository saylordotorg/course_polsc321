**Unit 3: Orientalism and the Problem of Methodology** <span
id="3"></span> 
*Historically, journalistic and scholarly attempts to understand the
Middle East have been frustrated by a variety of stereotypes and a
colonial or neocolonial political agenda.  The result has been a series
of (mis)representations and the production of a dominant discourse,
often referred to as “Orientalism.”  Within the discourse of
Orientalism, the Middle Easterner or “Oriental” is defined by the
Westerner or “Occidental” in a context of imperial domination.  The
Oriental plays the role of an “other” to the Occidental, in contrast to
which he defines himself.  The function of Orientalist discourse is to
order identity and to justify domination.  In this unit, you will
identify the components of Orientalism, summarize its deficiencies,
recognize instances of Orientalism in popular media and scholarship, and
identify how the problems associated with Orientalism might be
overcome.*
