**Unit 6: Turkey and Iran** <span id="6"></span> 
*Turkey and Iran both emerged as nation-states in the ruins of great
empires.  They followed similar paths to independence and have wrestled
with the challenges of democratization, human rights, political Islam,
and the accommodation of minorities.  In spite of these similarities,
Turkey and Iran have followed different paths in the last few decades. 
These differences can be explained, in part, by events and decisions
made in their struggle to constitute themselves as independent states. 
In this unit, you will chart the modern development of Turkey and Iran
and identify similarities and differences between the two societies.  *
