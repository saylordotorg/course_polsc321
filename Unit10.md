**Unit 10: Israel/Palestine: Independence and War** <span
id="10"></span> 
*In 1947, the UN issued a partition proposal for Palestine and, the next
year, Israel declared independence.  Three military conflicts
characterized this period as (1) Palestinians and Israelis joined
together to expel the British from Palestine, (2) Israelis and
Palestinians fought a civil war in Palestine, and (3) the newly
established state of Israel fought a war against its neighbors.  The
Palestinians were soundly defeated in this conflict and were left to
rely on traditional Arab powers to pursue their interests.  When this
policy failed, the Palestinians formed the Palestinian Liberation
Organization in an effort to represent itself.  Meanwhile a series of
wars were fought between Israel and the surrounding states, ending with
a historic peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.*  
    
 *In this unit, you will investigate Israel’s successful struggle for
independence and resistance to that independence among Palestinians and
the nations of the broader Middle East.  *
