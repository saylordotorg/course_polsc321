**Unit 7: Independence, Authoritarianism, and the Struggle to Constitute
New Identities** <span id="7"></span> 
*After World War II, many states of the Middle East became independent
from direct European control for the first time.  The leaders of these
states were faced with the challenge of constituting national identities
and legitimizing their power.  In an attempt to accomplish these goals,
they generally employed an authoritarian strategy of governance.  In
this section, you will investigate authoritarianism, as practiced in the
Middle East since the end of European colonialism.  In addition to the
constitution of national identities and the legitimation of new
governments, issues include control of domestic populations, the
influence of foreign powers, economic growth, and civil and regional
conflict. *
