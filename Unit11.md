**Unit 11: Israel/Palestine: Occupation and Negotiation** <span
id="11"></span> 
*In 1987, Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip began an
indigenous uprising against the Israeli occupation of those
territories.  In response to this uprising, called the intifada, a
series of negotiations began between the Israeli government and various
Palestinian leaders.  The negotiations continued from 1991 through 2001,
with agreements being alternately signed and violated.  After
negotiations failed at Taba in 2001, Israel adopted a new, unilateral
policy toward the Palestinians, called “Disengagement.”   
  
 In this unit, you will explore the origins and consequences of the
intifada, the peace process, and the Israeli Disengagement Plan.  In
addition, you will investigate possible solutions to the Arab-Israeli
conflict.*
