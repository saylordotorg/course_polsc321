At various points in history, the Middle East has been at the center of
world civilization.   In the last century, however, the Middle East has
been subjected to the conquest, colonization, and control of outside
powers: the Ottoman Empire, the great European powers, and the United
States.  This dynamic has had profound implications for the political
identity of both Middle Easterners and their conquerors.  It has also
meant that much of the recent political history of the Middle East has
been a struggle for independence and state-building—a struggle that
continues to this day with profound implications for the region and the
world as a whole. This course has two primary purposes: (1) to build a
critical understanding of the key issues and conflicts in the politics
of the modern Middle East and (2) to apply the following concepts to
these issues and conflicts: scholarly methodology, colonialism,
independence and state-building, the political mobilization of new
social classes, the spread of capitalist economic relations, Arab
nationalism, relations between the Arab states, the Middle East as an
arena of the Cold War, Islamic revivalism, globalization and economic
restructuring, democratization, and the significance of non-state
actors. These objectives will be pursued beginning with some framing
readings and videos on recent developments in the Middle East and on the
methods available to understand and analyze those developments.  You
will then inquire into the background of these recent developments
through study of the political history of various regions of the Middle
East and of foreign influence in those regions.  Toward the end of the
course, you will return to the most significant issues confronting the
region today for a more sustained and, ideally, more critical engagement
with them.

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Pay special attention to Units 1 and 2, as these lay the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material in later units.
 You will also need to complete the Final Exam.  
    
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through all of the resources in each unit.  
    
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **131**
**hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These

look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you have
over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and
decide to complete Unit 1 (a total of 4 hours) on Monday night; subunits
2.1 and 2.2 (a total of 4 hours) on Tuesday night; subunits 2.3 and 2.4
