**Unit 9: Israel/Palestine: Origins of the Conflict** <span
id="9"></span> 
*In the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, a group of European Jews, led by
Theodor Herzl, birthed a nationalist movement called Zionism, which had
the goal of securing a national homeland for the Jewish people.  After
several candidates were considered, these Zionists settled on Palestine
as the optimal location for this homeland.  As waves of Jewish migrants
began to arrive in Palestine, a resistance movement emerged among the
indigenous people and their allies in the surrounding Arab societies.*  
    
 *In this unit, you will investigate the origins of the Arab-Israeli
conflict, the role played by the British, the ideology animating
Zionism, and the approach taken to settling Palestine by early Zionist
migrants.*
