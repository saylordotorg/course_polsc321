**Unit 16: The Arab Uprisings of 2011** <span id="16"></span> 
*On December 17, 2010, a Tunisian fruit vendor named Mohamed Bouazizi
set himself on fire in frustration and in protest of the lack of
opportunity available to him in Tunisia.  This set off a political
uprising in Tunisia that soon spread to Egypt, Libya, and across whole
of the Middle East.  In this unit, you will investigate the causes of
these uprisings, the primary threats to democratization in the region,
and the systems of government that are likely to emerge from these
movements.*
