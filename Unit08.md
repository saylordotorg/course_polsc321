**Unit 8: Oil and the Political History of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf
States** <span id="8"></span> 
*The political history of Saudi Arabia differs dramatically from that of
the rest of the Middle East.  First, Saudi Arabia was never colonized by
European states, and, second, it sits on the world’s largest known oil

politics and in the broader region.  You will also explore Saudi
Arabia’s attempt to synthesize Wahhabism, monarchy, and modernization.*
